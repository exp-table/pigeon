A **Clean**, **Robust** Template for Foundry Projects.

### Usage

**Building & Testing**

Build the foundry project with `forge build`. Then you can run tests with `forge test`.

**Deployment & Verification**

Inside the [`utils/`](./utils/) directory are a few preconfigured scripts that can be used to deploy and verify contracts.

Scripts take inputs from the cli, using silent mode to hide any sensitive information.

_NOTE: These scripts are required to be _executable_ meaning they must be made executable by running `chmod +x ./utils/*`._

_NOTE: these scripts will prompt you for the contract name and deployed addresses (when verifying). Also, they use the `-i` flag on `forge` to ask for your private key for deployment. This uses silent mode which keeps your private key from being printed to the console (and visible in logs)._
