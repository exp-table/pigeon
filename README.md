A **Simple**, **Easy** tool to test cross-chain protocols.

## What is Pigeon?

Pigeon is a set of helper contracts, one per cross-chain protocol, that is designed to help you simulate as closely as possible how the cross-chain transaction would go.

## Usage

It is made to be as simple as instantiating the helper in your test file, and simple calling `help` with the appropriate parameters.
We have provided examples in the test files.

In short, it looks like this (for Hyperlane) :

```js
vm.recordLogs();
_someCrossChainFunctionInYourContract(L2_DOMAIN, TypeCasts.addressToBytes32(address(target)));
Vm.Log[] memory logs = vm.getRecordedLogs();
hyperlaneHelper.help(0x35231d4c2D8B8ADcB5617A638A0c4548684c7C70, L2_FORK_ID, logs);
```

**Warning**

As of now, it only supports the message execution and is not sensible to gas limits (which is a function of the fee you pay to the protocols usually).
